# CS-554 Assignment 6
Continued practice using Redis and `async/await`, this time with a more robust Express server. Leverages the Concurrently library to 
run the server and the worker at the same time.

To run the repo, ensure that `redis-server` is running and run:
```javascript
npm install
npm start
```

_Note: I need to revisit this assignment and refine the implementation. It's not my best work and I know I can produce a much better product._
